# Handwritten digits recognition model
#### Based on 3b1b's video about neural networks.

This repository includes:
- The essential algorithms and data structures for deep learning (`/src/network.py`)
- A brief presentation of the capabilities of deep learning 
in the form of a Jupyter Notebook (`/src/digitNN.ipynb`)
- MNIST dataset with `28x28px` images of handwritten digits used to train the 
demonstrated networks (`/resources`)
- a trained network in `.npz` format (`/network_data/network.npz`)
